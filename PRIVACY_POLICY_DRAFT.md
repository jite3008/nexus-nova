# Privacy Policy — Nuxes Nova (Draft)

_Last updated: August 21, 2025_

## Introduction
Nuxes Nova ("we", "our", "the App") provides a conversational assistant. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

## Information We Collect
- **Personal information** you provide (e.g., email for support).
- **Audio recordings** when you use voice features (only with explicit consent).
- **Usage data** (analytics, crash reports) — anonymized by default.

## How We Use Information
- To provide and improve the service (processing audio, generating responses).
- To contact users for support or important notices.
- To comply with legal obligations.

## Sharing & Third Parties
- We do not sell personal data. We may share data with service providers (hosting, analytics) under contract.
- If you integrate third-party APIs (e.g., cloud LLMs), disclose those services to users and include links to their privacy policies.

## Security
We implement reasonable security measures, but no service is 100% secure. Report issues to the support email.

## Your Rights
Users can request deletion or export of their personal data by contacting support.
