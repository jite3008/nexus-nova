## Assistant edits ‚Äî Advanced polish applied (Aug 21, 2025)
Added files and assets (ready for buyer preview):
- `iosApp/Info.plist` (CFBundleDisplayName: Nuxes Nova)
- `BUILD_AND_RELEASE.md` (Android AAB & iOS IPA steps)
- `PRIVACY_POLICY_DRAFT.md`
- `/assets_brand/` with 4 logo variants (SVG + PNG)
- `/assets_brand/play_screenshots/` with 4 placeholder 1080x1920 screenshots

What I improved:
- iOS display name and basic metadata added.
- Play Store screenshot mockups and multiple logo concepts.
- Release instructions and draft privacy policy for listing.

Next steps to reach $8,000 marketability: professional logo replacement, signed builds, manual QA, and seller documentation (transfer agreement).




## Rebrand: Nuxes Nova (added by assistant)
- App display name: **Nuxes Nova**
- Launcher icon and brand logo added (vector drawable).
- Suggested minimum sale price (realistic) for polished product: **$8,000 USD**.

### Why $8,000 is realistic (short rationale)
- Completed cross-platform Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile app with both Android and iOS skeletons.
- Built-in features: chat UI, onboarding, settings, audio recording, overlay service, networking ‚Äî significant dev effort saved.
- Included polished UI scaffold, brand assets, and developer README with build & store release notes.
- To command this price, include support (30-60 days), warranty, and optionally transfer of commercial IP.

### Quick polish checklist (applied)
- Updated Android app label to 'Nuxes Nova'.
- Added simple vector launcher icon (ic_launcher_foreground, brand_logo).
- Updated adaptive icon xml to point to new foreground.
- Added marketing blurb and suggested sale materials.

### Next recommended steps (for store submission)
1. Replace vector with a designer-quality SVG/PNG for high-res assets (512x512 for Play Console).
2. Provide screenshots (1080x1920 for phone) and a promo video.
3. Generate signed APK / AAB with production keystore; prepare iOS provisioning and export IPA.
4. Prepare privacy policy, support email, and app listing text.
